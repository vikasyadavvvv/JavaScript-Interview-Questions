# JavaScript Interview Questions

## 1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

### Answer:
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

### Primitive Data Types (Immutable, stored by value):
- `String` - represents textual data
- `Number` - represents numeric values
- `BigInt` - represents arbitrary-length integers
- `Boolean` - represents logical values `true` or `false`
- `Undefined` - represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
- `Null` - represents an intentional absence of any object value
- `Symbol` - represents unique and immutable identifiers

### Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:
- `Object` - represents collections of key-value pairs (includes:
  - `Array` - ordered lists
  - `Function` - callable objects
  - `Date` - date and time information
  - and other object types)
